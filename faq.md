### 🔹 Can I win without buying anything?

Yes. By submitting a mail-in entry with the correct information and being an active member, you are eligible to win. No purchase is required.

### 🔹 What are Bytes used for besides gifting?

Bytes can also be used to upgrade your profile image, play games like Tic Tac Toe, and unlock future features like preferred ticket number selection, messaging, and digital collectibles.

### 🔹 How are ticket numbers assigned?

Ticket numbers are randomly assigned before each draw. Your number is tied to your entry, whether gifted, mailed, or shop-based.

If your ticket number is drawn, you’ll be contacted via your registered email. Once verified, you can choose between check or electronic payout. You’ll also have the option to gift back a portion to the member who gifted you.

### 🔹 Can I track my entries?

Yes. Log into your member dashboard and open the Ticket Panel to view all your active ticket numbers and draw history.

### 🔹 How often are drawings held?

Drawings typically happen weekly and are streamed live. Drawing frequency and prize amount will always be posted in advance on the main site.

### 🔹 Can I change my Alias?

Only once. This ensures gifting consistency and reduces the risk of accidental misdirection.

If you win, you’ll be given the chance to gift a small portion of your prize back to the person who originally gifted you the Bytes that won. This is optional and encouraged, not required.

No. There is no betting, manipulation, or wagering. All entries are tied to gifts or free participation and selected using a fully transparent, livestreamed drawing system.
