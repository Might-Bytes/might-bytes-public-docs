## 🎮 Current Bytes-Powered Member Features

### 1. Tic Tac Toe Bytes Game  
Members are able to challenge each other in Bytes-based Tic Tac Toe games. This light, social game reinforces community participation.

### 2. Profile Image Upgrades  
Members are able to spend Bytes to upload a profile image. This improves identity recognition when users gift to strangers or promote their alias.

## 🛠️ Community Tools (In Development)

### 3. Alias Verification Badge  
Members who complete certain steps (e.g. receive 10+ gifts, have a verified email, upload an image) may earn a Bytes-powered verification badge.

### 4. Text-Based Gifting (in-platform messaging)  
Members will be able to message each other directly using Bytes. This feature will allow for Bytes gifting alongside friendly interaction.

### 5. Advocate Banners  
Members will be able to publicly advocate for a particular cause or advertise a specific product/service using a public view banner within their shared ticket panel.

### 6. Alias Banner for External Sharing  
A unique banner tool for members to promote their alias name on Pinterest, Instagram, or other social platforms with a clickable QR or gift request link.

## 🧩 Potential Long-Term Additions

### 7. Custom Bytes Skins / Collectibles  
Optional cosmetic variations of Bytes that members can gift or collect. These would serve no functional advantage but add community identity and fun.

### 8. Member Milestone Rewards  
Automatic Bytes or entry bonuses for hitting specific milestones (first random gift, 10th gift, 100th Bytes received, etc.)
