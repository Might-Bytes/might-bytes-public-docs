## 💵 Digital Gifting Entry ($5)

To enter using this method, users purchase a $5 bundle of Bytes and gift them to another member.

### Key Benefits:
- ✅ Each $5 gift generates **two entries**—one for the gifter and one for the recipient  
- ✅ Both users also receive Bytes to use in the community  
- ✅ Cheaper than most typical fees (processing, application, late, etc.)  
- ✅ Contributes to funding future prize amounts  
- ✅ Exceptionally high ROI

### How It Works:
1. User buys a $5 Bytes bundle  
2. They choose a member to gift (via Alias)  
3. Both users accumulate Bytes and are entered into the upcoming drawing

## ✉️ Free Mail-In Entry (No Purchase Required)

This option is available for members who wish to enter without purchasing Bytes.

### Key Requirements:
- Must have an **active, verified Might Bytes account**  
- Must include your Alias and contact information  
- Must include the **Alias of another member** (to fulfill gifting requirement)  
- One entry per properly submitted mail-in form

### How It Works:
1. Member writes a hand-written postcard containing the required information  
2. Postcard is mailed to the official Might Bytes P.O. Box (listed in the Rules section)  
3. Entry is manually logged by the admin team prior to the drawing

✅ Mail-in entries receive the same random ticket assignment process and have **equal odds** of winning compared to digital gifting entries.
