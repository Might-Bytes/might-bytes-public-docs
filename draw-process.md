## 🧠 How the Drawing Works

Each Might Bytes cash drawing is powered by a real-time dice roll event streamed live. The winning ticket is determined by matching the rolled result to a ticket number that has already been assigned to a member.

### 🎲 Key Components

- The drawing rules define:
  - How many dice will be rolled
  - The number of sides each die has (e.g., 6-sided, 10-sided)
- A fixed pool of possible number combinations is generated based on those settings
- Before the draw, the system randomly assigns ticket numbers from that pool to members and participating shops

### 🔢 Example

- If 3 dice are rolled and each has 6 sides, there are 216 possible outcomes
- Every entry is assigned a unique number from the pool
- The assigned number for each entry is linked to the member's Alias and account ID, or to an affiliate shop ticket holder

## 🎥 Live Drawing Execution

- The drawing is conducted live via video stream
- The designated host rolls the dice on camera in a single take
- The result of the roll is captured in the exact order of dice rolled
- That specific number is used to find the matching ticket number
- The member or affiliate shop participant who holds that assigned number is declared the winner

All ticket numbers are assigned prior to the draw, including:
- Bytes gifting entries
- Free mail-in entries
- Affiliate shop ticket assignments

## 🔐 Entry Types and Ticket Assignment

- **Gifted Bytes**: Each gift of Bytes to another member creates two entries:
  - One for the sender
  - One for the recipient

- **Mail-In Entries**: Manually entered and added to the ticket pool prior to the draw

- **Affiliate Shop Entries**: Participating businesses in the Might Bytes Affiliate Shops Program receive an assigned ticket number

All assigned ticket numbers are logged securely by the platform along with:
- Alias name  
- Entry type (Gift, Mail-In, or Affiliate Shop)  
- Timestamp

A record of all valid entries for each draw is maintained as a CSV file.

## 💛 Why This Method Works

- It blends true randomness (dice rolls + random ticket assignments) with accountable structure (assigned ticket pool)
- All ticket assignments are locked in prior to the draw—nothing is added or re-rolled
- Affiliate shops increase access and visibility for users in select communities
- Every roll is verifiable, visible, and tracked against a transparent ticket assignment record
